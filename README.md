# LearnSphere — 5-page Education Website

This is a small static site example with:

- `index.html` — Home (hero, features, promo)
- `about.html` — About page with lists (unordered + ordered)
- `courses.html` — Courses page containing a table (schedule)
- `resources.html` — Resources page with ordered and unordered lists
- `contact.html` — Contact page with an accessible HTML5 form
- `wireframe.html` — Low-fidelity wireframe showing layout blocks
- `css/styles.css` — Main stylesheet
- `js/main.js` — Responsive topnav toggling (w3schools topnav pattern)

How to view:

1. Open the folder `c:/Users/USER/Desktop/IsaaC education` in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or any page) to open in your browser.
3. Resize the browser to test the responsive navbar (or open the menu on small widths).

Notes:
- Images are linked from Unsplash for visual quality.
- Colors: deep blue primary (`#0b3d91`) with a coral accent (`#ff6f61`).
- The `wireframe.html` file provides a low-fidelity grayscale mockup summarizing page structure.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add local images into an `images/` folder.
- Commit these files to git and create a simple `index.html` demo server command.
- Produce higher-fidelity mockups in Figma or a prototype.
