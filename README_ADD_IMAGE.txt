Save any image attachments you want included on the site into this folder and name them as referenced by the pages.

To add the new brain+laptop image from the chat, save it here as:

  images/ai_brain.jpg

This project references that file in `resources.html` (gallery). You may also save other images here and I can add them to the gallery if you want.

Steps on Windows:
1. Download the image from the chat (right-click and Save As).
2. Move or copy the image into this folder: `c:\Users\USER\Desktop\IsaaC education\images\`
3. Rename it to `ai_brain.jpg` if necessary.

After placing the file, refresh `resources.html` or open `index.html` in your browser to see the updated visuals.
